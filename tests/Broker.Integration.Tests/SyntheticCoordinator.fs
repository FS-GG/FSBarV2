// SYNTHETIC FIXTURE: every test that uses this module substitutes a
// loopback `HighBarCoordinatorClient` for the eventual real BAR + HighBarV3
// plugin process (research §9). The broker-side wire path it exercises is
// real production code; the plugin peer is the synthetic part. Tracked in
// tasks.md (002) Synthetic-Evidence Inventory under T023 / T032 and in
// 001's inventory under T029 (closed by T033 in Phase 5).
